# Data Science Assignment  

This repository contains solutions for data analysis and machine learning tasks, including EDA with business insights, a Lookalike Model for customer recommendations, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Deliverables include Jupyter Notebooks, reports, and a Lookalike.csv file with similarity scores.
   

## Tasks Overview  

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
 
-  Objective : Perform EDA to uncover patterns and derive insights.  
-  Deliverables :  
  - `Nishant_Dixit_EDA.ipynb`  
  - Insights are summarized in the notebook.  

### Task 2: Lookalike Model 
 
-  Objective : Recommend 3 similar customers for each user based on profile and transaction data.  
-  Deliverables :  
  - `Nishant_Dixit_Lookalike.ipynb`  
  - Results saved in `Nishant_Dixit_Lookalike.csv`.  

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation/Clustering  

-  Objective : Segment customers into clusters using transaction and profile data.  
-  Deliverables :  
  - `Nishant_Dixit_Clustering.ipynb`  

## Requirements 
 
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
